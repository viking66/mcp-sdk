# Task: Implement Connection Management

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  
**Estimated effort**: 1 day (SDE2 level)  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Package**: mcp-client
**Prerequisites**: 
- Client initialization (001-initialization)
- Stdio transport (004-stdio-transport)
- Protocol handshake types (mcp-core/protocol/004-handshake-types)

## Context
We need to implement robust connection management for MCP clients. This includes handling connection establishment, maintenance, reconnection logic, and graceful shutdown. The implementation should handle various error conditions and provide proper feedback about connection state.

## Requirements
1. Define connection management types
2. Implement connection lifecycle
3. Create reconnection handling
4. Support health checking
5. Enable connection monitoring

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Connection Types

```haskell
-- File: src/MCP/Client/Connection/Types.hs

-- Core connection types
data ConnectionManager = ConnectionManager
    { config :: !ConnectionConfig
    , state :: !(TVar ConnectionState)
    , transport :: !Transport
    , monitor :: !ConnectionMonitor
    , stats :: !(TVar ConnectionStats)
    } deriving (Eq)

data ConnectionConfig = ConnectionConfig
    { retryPolicy :: !RetryPolicy
    , healthCheck :: !HealthCheckConfig
    , timeout :: !TimeoutConfig
    , keepAlive :: !KeepAliveConfig
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

data ConnectionState
    = Disconnected
    | Connecting !ConnectionPhase
    | Connected !ConnectedInfo
    | Reconnecting !RetryCount
    | Failed !ConnectionError
    deriving (Eq, Show)
```

### 2. Connection Lifecycle

```haskell
-- Lifecycle types
data ConnectionPhase
    = TransportSetup
    | HandshakeStart
    | CapabilityNegotiation
    | HealthCheck
    deriving (Eq, Show)

data ConnectedInfo = ConnectedInfo
    { connectedAt :: !UTCTime
    , serverInfo :: !ServerInfo
    , negotiatedFeatures :: ![ProtocolCapability]
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

-- Lifecycle functions
establishConnection :: ConnectionManager -> IO (Either ConnectionError ())
maintainConnection :: ConnectionManager -> IO ()
terminateConnection :: ConnectionManager -> IO ()
```

### 3. Health Checking

```haskell
-- Health check types
data HealthCheckConfig = HealthCheckConfig
    { interval :: !NominalDiffTime
    , timeout :: !NominalDiffTime
    , failureThreshold :: !Int
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

data HealthStatus
    = Healthy
    | Degraded !Text
    | Unhealthy !Text
    deriving (Eq, Show)

-- Health check functions
performHealthCheck :: ConnectionManager -> IO HealthStatus
monitorHealth :: ConnectionManager -> IO ()
handleHealthFailure :: ConnectionManager -> HealthStatus -> IO ()
```

### 4. Reconnection Handling

```haskell
-- Reconnection types
data RetryPolicy = RetryPolicy
    { maxAttempts :: !Int
    , backoffStrategy :: !BackoffStrategy
    , timeout :: !NominalDiffTime
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

data BackoffStrategy
    = ConstantBackoff !NominalDiffTime
    | LinearBackoff !NominalDiffTime
    | ExponentialBackoff
        { initial :: !NominalDiffTime
        , multiplier :: !Double
        , maxDelay :: !NominalDiffTime
        }
    deriving (Eq, Show)

-- Reconnection functions
handleDisconnect :: ConnectionManager -> ConnectionError -> IO ()
attemptReconnect :: ConnectionManager -> IO (Either ConnectionError ())
calculateBackoff :: BackoffStrategy -> RetryCount -> NominalDiffTime
```

## Testing Requirements

1. Unit Tests:
   - Connection lifecycle
   - Health checking
   - Reconnection logic
   - Error handling

2. Integration Tests:
   - With real transports
   - Error scenarios
   - Recovery behavior

3. Property Tests:
   - State transitions
   - Backoff strategies
   - Health checks

## Files to Create/Modify
1. `src/MCP/Client/Connection/Types.hs` - Connection types
2. `src/MCP/Client/Connection/Health.hs` - Health checking
3. `src/MCP/Client/Connection/Retry.hs` - Reconnection logic
4. `test/MCP/Client/Connection/ConnectionSpec.hs` - Tests
5. Update `mcp-client.cabal` with new modules

## Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  - stm
  - async
  - time
  - retry
```

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Connection management working
2. Health checking functional
3. Reconnection handling complete
4. State tracking accurate
5. Error handling robust
6. Full test coverage
7. Documentation complete
8. Code passes style checks

## Non-Goals
