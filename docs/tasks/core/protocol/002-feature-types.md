# Task: Implement Feature Negotiation Types

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  
**Estimated effort**: 1 day (SDE2 level)  
**Priority**: Highest (P0)  
**Package**: mcp-core
**Prerequisites**: 
- Protocol version types (001-version-types)

## Context
We need to implement types and functionality for MCP protocol feature negotiation, allowing clients and servers to agree on supported capabilities during connection establishment. The system needs to handle both required and optional features, with proper validation and error handling.

## Requirements
1. Define feature negotiation types
2. Implement capability detection
3. Create negotiation process
4. Support feature requirements
5. Enable feature validation

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Feature Types

```haskell
-- File: src/MCP/Core/Protocol/Feature.hs

-- Core capability types
data Capability = Capability
    { capabilityId :: !CapabilityId
    , level :: !CapabilityLevel
    , requirements :: ![CapabilityRequirement]
    , metadata :: !CapabilityMetadata
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

newtype CapabilityId = CapabilityId 
    { unCapabilityId :: Text }
    deriving (Eq, Show, IsString)

-- Capability levels
data CapabilityLevel
    = Required
    | Optional
    | Experimental
    deriving (Eq, Show)

-- Metadata
data CapabilityMetadata = CapabilityMetadata
    { description :: !(Maybe Text)
    , since :: !Version
    , deprecated :: !Bool
    , stability :: !StabilityLevel
    } deriving (Eq, Show)
```

### 2. Requirements System

```haskell
-- Requirements
data CapabilityRequirement
    = VersionRequirement !VersionConstraint
    | FeatureRequirement !CapabilityId
    | ResourceRequirement !ResourceConstraint
    | CustomRequirement !Text !Value
    deriving (Eq, Show)

data ResourceConstraint = ResourceConstraint
    { resource :: !Text
    , minValue :: !(Maybe Integer)
    , maxValue :: !(Maybe Integer)
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

-- Requirement checking
checkRequirements :: [CapabilityRequirement] -> FeatureContext -> Either FeatureError ()
validateRequirements :: [CapabilityRequirement] -> Either FeatureError ()
```

### 3. Negotiation Process

```haskell
-- Negotiation types
data FeatureNegotiation = FeatureNegotiation
    { clientCapabilities :: ![Capability]
    , serverCapabilities :: ![Capability]
    , requirements :: ![CapabilityRequirement]
    , context :: !FeatureContext
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

data FeatureContext = FeatureContext
    { version :: !Version
    , resources :: !(Map Text Integer)
    , features :: !(Set CapabilityId)
    } deriving (Eq, Show)

-- Negotiation result
data NegotiationResult
    = Succeeded !NegotiatedFeatures
    | Failed ![FeatureError]
    deriving (Eq, Show)

data NegotiatedFeatures = NegotiatedFeatures
    { supported :: ![Capability]
    , unsupported :: ![Capability]
    , partial :: ![(Capability, [CapabilityRequirement])]
    } deriving (Eq, Show)
```

### 4. Feature Detection

```haskell
-- Detection types
data FeatureDetection = FeatureDetection
    { capabilities :: ![Capability]
    , context :: !FeatureContext
    }

-- Detection functions
detectCapabilities :: FeatureDetection -> Either FeatureError [Capability]
verifyCapability :: Capability -> FeatureContext -> Either FeatureError Bool
findMissingRequirements :: Capability -> FeatureContext -> [CapabilityRequirement]

-- Query utilities
hasCapability :: CapabilityId -> NegotiatedFeatures -> Bool
getCapabilityLevel :: CapabilityId -> NegotiatedFeatures -> Maybe CapabilityLevel
listCapabilities :: CapabilityLevel -> NegotiatedFeatures -> [Capability]
```

## Testing Requirements

1. Property Tests:
   - Feature negotiation
   - Requirement checking
   - Capability detection

2. Unit Tests:
   - All capability types
   - Negotiation process
   - Error handling

3. Integration Tests:
   - With version system
   - Resource constraints
   - Complex negotiations

## Files to Create/Modify
1. `src/MCP/Core/Protocol/Feature.hs` - Core feature types
2. `src/MCP/Core/Protocol/Capability.hs` - Capability handling
3. `src/MCP/Core/Protocol/Negotiation.hs` - Negotiation logic
4. `test/MCP/Core/Protocol/FeatureSpec.hs` - Tests
5. Update `mcp-core.cabal` with new modules

## Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  - text
  - containers
  - aeson
```

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Feature types implemented
2. Negotiation working
3. Requirements checking functional
4. Detection complete
5. Error handling robust
6. Full test coverage
7. Documentation complete
8. Code passes style checks

## Non-Goals
1. Feature discovery
2. Dynamic capabilities
3. Capability updates
4. Complex dependencies

## Resources
1. MCP Protocol Specification
2. Feature Negotiation Patterns
3. Capability Detection Examples
