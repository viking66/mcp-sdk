# MCP SDK Task Priorities

This document outlines the prioritized implementation tasks for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Haskell SDK.

## Priority 1: Core Package Foundation
Critical for all other components to function.

### mcp-core implementation:
1. Protocol message types and schemas
2. JSON-RPC message handling
3. Error handling types
4. Transport interface definitions
5. Basic resource/prompt/tool types
6. Protocol version management

## Priority 2: Basic Server Implementation
Enables testing with real clients like Claude Desktop.

### mcp-server essential features:
1. Server initialization
2. Basic resource serving
3. Simple tool execution
4. Stdio transport
5. Basic session management

## Priority 3: Testing Infrastructure
Ensures reliability as we build out features.

1. Property testing framework
2. Protocol conformance tests
3. Basic integration tests
4. Example server implementations

## Priority 4: Client Implementation
Needed for full protocol support.

### mcp-client essential features:
1. Client initialization
2. Resource reading
3. Tool execution
4. Stdio transport
5. Connection management

## Priority 5: Documentation
Essential for adoption.

1. API documentation
2. Basic usage examples
3. Architecture overview
4. Quick start guide

## Priority 6: Advanced Server Features
Enhances functionality.

1. Resource updates/subscriptions
2. Prompt templates
3. Advanced tool features
4. SSE transport

## Priority 7: Advanced Client Features
Completes the implementation.

1. Resource subscription
2. Prompt handling
3. Advanced tool interactions
4. SSE transport

## Priority 8: Development Environment
Improves developer experience.

1. HLS configuration
2. Formatter setup
3. Linter configuration
4. Development scripts

## Priority 9: CI/CD
Ensures quality.

1. Basic GitHub Actions
2. Automated testing
3. Documentation generation

## Priority 10: Additional Tools
Nice to have.

1. Debugging utilities
2. Project templates
3. Example servers

## Implementation Strategy

The priorities are ordered based on the following rationale:

1. Core types must come first as everything depends on them
2. Basic server implementation allows early testing with real clients
3. Testing infrastructure ensures reliability as we build
4. Client implementation enables full protocol support
5. Documentation is necessary for adoption
6. Advanced features can be added once basics work
7. Development environment improvements can be gradual
8. CI/CD can be enhanced over time
9. Additional tools can be added as needed

Each priority level should be substantially complete before moving to the next, though some parallel work may be possible between levels when dependencies allow.
